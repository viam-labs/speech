# speech modular service

*speech* is a modular service that provides text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text(STT) capabilities for robots running on the Viam platform.

## Prerequisites

On Linux:

`run.sh` will automatically install the following system dependencies if not already set up on the machine:

- python3-pyaudio
- portaudio19-dev
- alsa-tools
- alsa-utils
- flac

On MacOS:

``` bash
brew install portaudio
```

## API

The speech resource provides the following API:

### say(*string*, blocking=*bool*)

The *say()* command takes a string, and converts to speech audio that is played back on the robot, provided it has an audio output (speaker) device attached.
It returns a string response, which is the string that was passed in to the *say()* request.

If blocking is set to True, will wait until the speech is said to return.

### completion(*string*, blocking=*bool*)

The *completion()* command takes a string, sends that to an AI LLM completion provider (if configured) and converts the returned completion to speech audio that is played back on the robot, provided it has an audio output (speaker) device attached.
It returns a string response, which is the completion returned from the completion provider.

If blocking is set to True, will wait until the speech is said to return.

### get_commands(*integer*)

The *get_commands()* command takes an integer representing the number of commands to return, and returns that number of commands as a list of strings from the FIFO command buffer, removing them from that buffer at the time of return.
Commands will exist in the buffer if [listen](#listen) is configured and the robot has heard any commands (triggered by [listen_trigger_command](#listen_trigger_command)).
This enables voice-activated programmatic control of the robot.

### listen_trigger(type=*enum(say|completion|command)*)

The next phrase heard will trigger *say*, *completion* or *command*, depending on the trigger_type passed in.
No trigger string is required, but any configured trigger string will be respected.

### is_speaking()

Will return True if the speech module is currently speaking.

## Viam Service Configuration

The following attributes may be configured as speech service config attributes.
For example: the following configuration would set up listening mode, use an ElevenLabs voice "Antoni", make AI completions available, and use a 'Gollum' persona for AI completions:

``` json
{
  "completion_provider_org": "org-abc123",
  "completion_provider_key": "sk-mykey",
  "completion_persona": "Gollum",
  "listen": true,
  "speech_provider": "elevenlabs",
  "speech_provider_key": "keygoeshere",
  "speech_voice": "Antoni",
  "mic_device_name": "myMic"
}
```

### speech_provider

*enum - "google"|"elevenlabs" (default: "google")*

### speech_provider_key

*string (default: "")*

### speech_voice

*string (default: "Josh")*

If the speech_provider (example: elevenlabs) provides voice options, the voice can be selected here.

### completion_provider

*enum - "openai" (default: "openai")*

Other providers may be supported in the future.  [completion_provider_org](#completion_provider_org) and [completion_provider_key](#completion_provider_key) must also be provided.

### completion_model

*enum - "gpt-4|gpt-3.5-turbo" (default: "gpt-4")*

Other models may be supported in the future.  [completion_provider_org](#completion_provider_org) and [completion_provider_key](#completion_provider_key) must also be provided.

### completion_provider_org

*string (default: "")*

### completion_provider_key

*string (default: "")*

### completion_persona

*string (default: "")*

If set, will pass "As <completion_persona> respond to '<completion_text>'" to all completion() requests.

### listen

*boolean (default: false)*

If set to true and the robot as an available microphone device, will enable listening in the background.

If enabled, it will respond to configured [listen_trigger_say](#listen_trigger_say), [listen_trigger_completion](#listen_trigger_completion) and [listen_trigger_command](#listen_trigger_command), based on input audio being converted to text.

If *listen* is enabled and [listen_triggers_active](#listen_triggers_active) is disabled, triggers will occur when [listen_trigger](#listen_trigger) is called.

Note that background (ambient) noise and microphone quality are important factors in the quality of the STT conversion.
Currently, Google STT is leveraged.

### listen_phrase_time_limit

*float (default: None)*

The maximum number of seconds that this will allow a phrase to continue before stopping and returning the part of the phrase processed before the time limit was reached.
The resulting audio will be the phrase cut off at the time limit.
If phrase_timeout is None, there will be no phrase time limit.
Note: if you are seeing instance where phrases are not being returned for much longer than you expect, try changing this to ~5 or so.

### listen_trigger_say

*string (default: "robot say")*

If *listen* is true, any audio converted to text that is prefixed with *listen_trigger_say* will be converted to speech and repeated back by the robot.

### listen_trigger_completion

*string (default: "hey robot")*

If *listen* is true, any audio converted to text that is prefixed with *listen_trigger_completion* will be sent to the completion provider (if configured), converted to speech, and repeated back by the robot.

### listen_trigger_command

*string (default: "robot can you")*

If [listen](#listen) is true, any audio converted to text that is prefixed with *listen_trigger_command* will be stored in a LIFO buffer (list of strings) of size [listen_command_buffer_length](#listen_command_buffer_length) that can be retrieved via [get_commands()](#get_commandsinteger), enabling programmatic voice control of the robot.

### listen_command_buffer_length

*integer (default: 10)*

### mic_device_name

*string (default: "")*

If not set, will attempt to use the first available microphone device.
If set, will attempt to use a specifically labeled device name.
Available microphone device names will logged on module startup.

### cache_ahead_completions

*boolean (default: false)*

If true, will read a second completion for the request and cache it for next time a matching request is made.
This is useful for faster completions when completion text is less variable.

### disable_mic

*boolean (default: false)*

If true, will not configure any listening capabilities.
This must be set to true if you do not have a valid microphone attached to your system.

## Using speech with the Python SDK

Because this module uses a custom protobuf-based API, you must include this project in your client code.  One way to do this is to include it in your requirements.txt as follows:

``` txt
audioout @ git+https://github.com/viam-labs/speech.git@main
```

You can now import and use it in your code as follows:

``` python
from speech import SpeechService
speech = SpeechService.from_robot(robot, name="speech")
speech.say(...)
```

For now, the protobuf bindings are only generated for Python.

## Troubleshooting

When using a USB audio device, it may sometimes come up as the default, sometimes not.  To ensure that it comes up consistently as the default:

1. check the existing alsa modules:

```
cat /proc/asound/modules
```

This will output something like:

```
 0 snd_usb_audio
 2 snd_soc_meson_card_utils
 3 snd_usb_audio
```

2. ensure the USB device comes up first by editing /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf, adding content similar to:

```
options snd slots=snd-usb-audio,snd_soc_meson_card_utils
```
